The Odin Recipes project is part of the curriculum from The Odin 
Project. In this project, we are tasked with creating a basic recipe 
website that demonstrates our understanding of HTML and CSS. The 
website will showcase various recipes, and users can view the 
details of each recipe, such as ingredients, instructions, and 
images.

This project will allow me to practice structuring a webpage using 
HTML and styling it with CSS, focusing on layout, typography, and 
responsiveness. By the end of the project, I will have a 
well-rounded understanding of web development concepts that will 
serve as a foundation for future projects.
